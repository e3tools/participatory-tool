Several fundamental tenets form the foundation of PLA methodology, including the idea that the facilitator should \u201chand over the stick\u201d to allow participants to describe their own experience and reality as they understand it. The facilitator also aligns his or her behavior to several key precepts inherent to this methodology, including the promotion of open sharing among participants, the use of visual aids and tangible objects, and collaboration through group work.\n</p>\n\n<h3><u><span style=\"color: #c0392b;\">Approach</span></u></h3>\n<p>\nThe underlying principle behind the Participatory Learning and Action (PLA) methodology is to engage the full participation of people in the processes of learning about their needs and opportunities, and in the action required to address them. By empowering participants to creatively investigate issues of their concern, the approach challenges preexisting biases and conceptions about participants\u2019 knowledge. As such, it can also offer opportunities for local people to mobilize for joint action.\n</p>\n\n<h3><u><span style=\"color: #c0392b;\">Key Tenets of Facilitation</span></u></h3>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Introduce yourself to the participants, if possible in the local language, in order to make them feel comfortable</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Have confidence in the abilities and contributions of participants</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Critically reflect on your own perspective and biases before, during, and after the<br>activity</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ask participants for their own opinions, priorities, and desires throughout the activity</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Be patient during the activity, allowing sufficient time for each participant to fully<br>contribute</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Allow participants to lead the discussion</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Facilitate the activity in an informal manner without lecturing or dictating</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Learn from what goes wrong or does not work in the activity</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Hand over the stick&rdquo; and empower participants by allowing them to take charge of<br>the writing, drawing, or other elements of the activity</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Take responsibility for what you do as a facilitator, before, during, and after the<br>activity</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Welcome moments of silence as these may be necessary for participants to collect<br>their thoughts</li>\n</ol>"

Ask consent before recording or taking photos.\n</li>\n<li>\nGive everyone a chance to participate, if desired. Dominating participants should not detract from the participation of others.\n</li>\n<li>\nEncourage the translator to repeat everything said in both languages, so that all participants are guaranteed an equal opportunity to fully understand and engage in the activity.\n</li>\n<li>\nPosition yourself at the eye level of the participants when giving instructions or asking questions, which may necessitate sitting, squatting, or kneeling with the participants.\n</li>\n<li>\nAim questions at the image itself instead of one specific person when asking follow-up questions and interviewing the map/diagram. This will encourage all participants to feel equally able to answer the question.\n</li>\n</ol>\n"
